# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
deploy backend
yarn run ts-node --files .\scripts\Deployment.ts frutilla vainilla chocolate

RUN Api
yarn start:dev

RUN Frontend
npm run dev

```
